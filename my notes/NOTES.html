#Training to become a web developer
Firstly i started off by downloading my code editor and web browser,then i set the web browser i chose to use as my default browser.I also noted that there were various options available, based on the directory from which i would like to access my projects or in other words based on my preferences while i was installing the code editor.

After starting up my code editor i customized some of my settings such as word wrap,auto save e.t.c.for easy workflow.
Then i delved into html by getting accustomed to the html structure, using its latest version HTML5.
Then i practiced using some elements while noting that some elements came with opening and closing tags while other elements came with just one tag .
examples of elements involved with opening and closing tags are the html root element(<html></html>),head element(<head></head>),body element(<body></body>),heading elements;h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 etc.,noting that the size of the heading increases from h6-h1.
